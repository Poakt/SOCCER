Ipswich beat Coventry home-and-away last season, thereby seeking three successive victories in this fixture for the first time since 2007.

The Tractor Boys are unbeaten in five away games against the Sky Blues, most recently beaten in this part of the West Midlands 16 years ago.

Coventry City vs Ipswich Town Preview
Can 1978 winners Ipswich Town reach the FA Cup fifth round for the first time since 2007? In the previous round, the Tractor Boys swatted aside Bristol Rovers 3-0 in Suffolk, with Kalvin Phillips, Jack Clarke and Jack Taylor all scoring. Then, Ali Al-Hamadi took one of the worst penalties you're ever likely to see; thankfully for him, this was a mere footnote.

However, in the Premier League, Kieran McKenna's team have now suffered four successive defeats, with their hopes of survival taking a ginormous blow at the weekend. They were beaten 2-1 by rock-bottom Southampton at Portman Road, the winner coming right at the end. Thus, can Ipswich claim a much-needed, morale-boosting FA Cup victory?

Coventry City won this trophy in 1987 and, having ousted Sheffield Wednesday on penalties in round three, come into this tie full of confidence.

Frank Lampard's side made it four successive victories by beating Swansea 2-0 last weekend, their first away win over the Swans for 75 years, before Wednesday night's 2-0 defeat at the hands of league-leaders Leeds.

Nevertheless, this previous winning streak has propelled the Sky Blues up to 11th, just four points off sixth, hoping to make a late play-off push, and the home side will certainly fancy their chances of victory at the Coventry Building Society Arena.

Ipswich Town Team News
Kieran McKenna heavily rotated against Bristol Rovers in round three, but will he go a bit stronger this time? Arijanet Muriç returned in goal against Southampton, after five games on the bench, but did little to stake a claim.

However, with Christian Walton sidelined due to a foot injury, the Kosovar international will be donning the gloves again.

Elsewhere, Sam Szmodics, Wes Burns, Conor Chaplin and Chiedozie Ogbene are sidelined, but new signings Julio Enciso and Jaden Philogene could start, the latter thereby included in an Ipswich XI for the very first time; Ben Johnson, Ben Godfrey and Kalvin Phillips could also come into the lineup.

Ipswich Town predicted lineup vs Coventry City: (4-3-3): Muriç; Johnson, Godfrey, Tuanzebe, Davis; Morsy, Phillips, Hutchinson, Enciso, Philogene; Delap.

Ipswich Town Player to Watch vs Coventry City
Liam Delap has nine Premier League goals to his name this season, but has never previously netted against Coventry in four attempts, these coming with three different clubs, so can he change that fact on Saturday?

Coventry City vs Ipswich Town Prediction
We think this tie is primed for an upset. Coventry are in excellent form, Ipswich less so, albeit at a higher level, but we're forecasting a victory for the Sky Blues: Coventry City 2-1 Ipswich Town.
