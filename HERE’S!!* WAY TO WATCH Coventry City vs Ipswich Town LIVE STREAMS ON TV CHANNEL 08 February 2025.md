What has Lampard said about the game?
"Ipswich were a fantastic side in the Championship last year. "They've also gone and added to their squad and are competing in the Premier League, playing at that level week in and week out, so it feels like they'll be the strongest team we have played against, pound for pound.

"But maybe that's where the Leeds game can provide some valuable little pointers for us in terms of that step up in quality and what it means for us with and without the ball, because we could be better than we were against Leeds on both fronts. "So we'll see."

He added: "For me, Cup runs are generally always good for confidence. "You want to manage the squad, you want to have as many games and FA Cup games deep into the competition are great things.

"So you know, we like to think we want to win every game that we play. "You approach every game as it comes and I'm not going with any other thought than trying to win the game to get to the next round."
